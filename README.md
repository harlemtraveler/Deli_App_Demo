# A serverless Deli App built on AWS Amplify

Blah, blah, blah

## What we've built

In the project we've built:
- Fullstack Serverless App
- GraphQL API
- User Authentication
- Full-text Search with Elasticsearch
- Serverless Express App in the form of a Lambda function
- Real-time data with GraphQL Subscriptions
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

### Updates in consideration
- Converting the "Register User" logic into a Lambda Trigger to move it to the backend.
- Execute AppSync queries and mutations from Lambda functions
